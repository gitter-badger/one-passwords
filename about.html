## About

One Passwords is an experimental proof of [concept](https://panossakkos.github.io/tech/2015/11/01/one-passwords.html)
and shouldn't be used or relied upon it.
It tries to make the handling of passwords easier and safe at the same time.
Select one secret passphrase and then use it in combination with the service name that you want to generate a password for.

One Passwords doesn't store your passwords anywhere, because the generated passwords are block hashes of Bitcoin's Block chain.
