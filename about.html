## About

One Passwords makes your password management easier and safe at the same time.
Select one secret passphrase and then use it in combination with the service name that you
want to get your password of.
When you decide to change your passwords in order to be more safe, simply choose a new secret passphrase.

One Passwords doesn't store your passwords anywhere, because the generated passwords are hashes of Bitcoin's Blockchain.
