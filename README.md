# one-passwords

## About
One Passwords is a password manager which doesn't store any passwords. 
The passwords are hashes of blocks in the Bitcoin's Blockchain.
The corresponsing block to assign as a password is computed by hashing the 
user's secret passphrase and the service name that he wants to get the password for.
